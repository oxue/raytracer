Compile with premake4 gmake && make
Tested on gl36.student.cs machine

Extra Feature:

* Reflections

Unique Scene: 

* A winter scene with a snowman and cow and frozen lake. There are rocks in the lake and trees on the shore. There is a happy cow skating on the ice. The lake is reflective

Acceleration: (OFF by default)

* To enable, run the binary with the -acc switch: './A4 -acc Assets/sample.lua'
* Acceleration works by having a hierarchy of bounding spheres for every mesh, node, primitive etc. This means for a scene with many nested nodes, there are many nested spheres each properly contained in their parent sphere. 
* Acceleration is demonstrated by macho-cows-bb.png. The primitives all have bounding spheres including the floor, we are inside that sphere so thats why the background is green. The reason that arcs have part of the bounding sphere cut off is to show they are further inside a bounding sphere encapsulating the arc object, so those regions don't get rendered. 
* In practice the spheres containing spheres and cubes are skipped because the cost of an extra sphere-ray intersection is not worth it when there is only one child, but they are rendered in macho-cows-bb.png anyways, for consistency.

* The following is time spent rendering macho-cows with and without -acc switch:

(WITH -acc)
real	0m29.260s
user	0m28.144s
sys	0m0.267s

(WITHOUT -acc)
real	6m57.816s
user	6m29.006s
sys	0m4.247s
