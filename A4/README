To compile just use premake4 gmake && make release=config

I built on top of A4 so the files are in Ar directory

The many features are enabled through #define flags  in the top of A4.cpp; My usual workflow is:
- change flags
- cd A4
- make config=release && ./A4 -acc Assets/prim.lua

note the config release flag is used for performance and the -acc flag is used for bounding sphere acceleration

Below are a list of objectives. My A4 objective was reflection
[x] 1: Implement Cone and Cylinder Primitives  
[x] 2: Texture Mapping  
[x] 3: Normal Mapping  
[x] 4: Adaptive Anti Aliasing  
[x] 5: Glossy Reflection  
[x] 6: Grid Acceleration  
[x] 7: Depth of field  
[x] 8: Motion Blur  
[x] 9: Refraction 
[x] 10: Final Scene

[x] Extra: Soft Shadows

An [x] indicates the objective was completed as of this submission

The renders are in A4 directory, and here they are associated with the corresponding objective, and some short comments



=============================== Cone and Cylinder Primitives ==============================
Used in conjunction with DOF to produce pleasing image

=============================== Texture Mapping ===========================================
Rudimentary refraction is also included in this screenshot

-textures.png



=============================== Normal Mapping ============================================
This clearly shows normal mapping with 2 different colored lights!

=============================== Adaptive Anti Aliasing ====================================
one of the screenshots hilights the AA candidates in red

=============================== Glossy Reflection =========================================

=============================== Grid Acceleration =========================================
I rendered 100, 1000, 10000 spheres to test out the speed of using grid and not;

the numbers:

100
real	0m2.798s grid
================= 
real	0m0.440s no grid

1000
real	0m4.265s grid
================= 
real	0m4.978s no grid

10000
real	0m16.748s grid
================= 
real	0m40.861s no grid

- grid.png (what 10k spheres looks like)



=============================== Depth of field ============================================
DOF has 2 renders, close and far, I can control the focal distance

=============================== Motion Blur ===============================================
with and without rotations

-motion blur with cube and rotation.png
-motion blur with soft shadows.png



=============================== Refraction ================================================
frenel is included!

=============================== Final Scene ===============================================
Tribute to MC escher 3 worlds, this is 4 worlds becase of the world in the bubble
